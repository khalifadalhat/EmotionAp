Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) System
Introduction
Welcome to the Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) System project repository! This project focuses on the development of a state-of-the-art FER system that can efficiently recognize and classify human emotions from facial expressions. Understanding and interpreting human emotions from visual cues is a critical aspect of human-computer interaction and has wide-ranging applications in various fields.

Project Overview
Objective: The primary aim of this project is to design, develop, and evaluate a robust FER system capable of accurately recognizing basic emotions, including anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, neutral, and surprise.

Background: Human communication heavily relies on facial expressions to convey emotions, making FER systems valuable for applications such as mental health monitoring, education, marketing, and security.

Scope: This project explores the potential of FER in healthcare, education, marketing, and security domains, while also addressing ethical considerations and privacy concerns associated with FER technology.
